# General Info
Some codes regarding "Distributed approximate $k$-core decomposition and minâ€“max edge orientation: Breaking the diameter barrier" (T-H. Hubert Chan, Mauro Sozio and Bintao Sun; IPDPS 2019 & JPDC 2021).

Please feel free to use the codes as you wish.

# Note
Unfortunately, these codes were not released with the publication. They lack organization and documentation, and are not even guaranteed to compile and run successfully. We hope, nonetheless, that they offer some value to those interested in the ideas explored during the development of the published work.
